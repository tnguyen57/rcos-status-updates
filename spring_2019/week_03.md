## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I attempted to get the right click popup menu to pop up. I learned how to make the menu visible
> and invisible.

## This Week's Plan

> Work on the Popup menu some more. Make it appear on right click and disappear on left click.

## Anything Blocking?

> I wanted to talk to Leon, but there wasn't a small group meaning for the last two weeks.
> I talked to him today, and he helped me get unstuck.
