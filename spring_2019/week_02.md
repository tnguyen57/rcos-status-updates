## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In the past week, I worked on the right click context menu. I wanted to finish it,
> but it ended up being harder then anticipated. I transferred the php code from the old
> website. I understand php better now. I'm still struggling with javascript and typescript.

## This Week's Plan

> For the next week, I hope to finish the right context menu. 

> Talk to Leon to understand how input and mouse click location was implemented.

## Anything Blocking?

> The main thing blocking me currently is my lack of knowledge of typescript. I found
> sound resources which I found useful, but the resources use javascript.

> The current code is useful, but I have trouble understanding how input and mouse
> clicks are done and how to modify it for the right click menu.
