## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In the past week, I implemented the unit test for the BUFGate class for the project. I also
> looked at the code right click popup menu in the last part.

## This Week's Plan

> For the next week, I hope to get the basic right click popup menu to be working. I will
> try to implement the menu poping up, and disappearing when clicked off of.

## Anything Blocking?

> Currently, the thing blocking me is my lack of knowledge of typescript, javascript, and php.
> I don't know the syntax to well and this is the biggest block currently. This would make it
> hard to transfer the current code from JS to typescript.
